        # Owner of the repo hosting the package.
        # Defaults to the owner of the repo executing the workflow.

        #num-old-versions-to-delete:

        # The number of latest versions to keep.
        # This cannot be specified with `num-old-versions-to-delete`. By default, `num-old-versions-to-delete` takes precedence over `min-versions-to-keep`.
        # When set to 0, all deletable versions will be deleted.
        # When set greater than 0, all deletable package versions except the specified number will be deleted.

        # If true it will delete only the pre-release versions.
        # The number of pre-release versions to keep can be set by using `min-versions-to-keep` value with this.
        # When `min-versions-to-keep` is 0, all pre-release versions get deleted.

        # The token used to authenticate with GitHub Packages.
        # Defaults to github.token.

        #   If `package-version-ids` is given the token only needs the delete packages scope.
        #   If `package-version-ids` is not given the token needs the delete packages scope and the read packages scope
